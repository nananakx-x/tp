**Foster Family** is a desktop app built for the **foster managers of cat and dog shelters** to help them perform **foster family management tasks**. 

Some tasks Foster Family can help you with: 
* **Store and update** the important details of animal fosterers
* Search for a fosterer using _**any**_ detail you can remember of them
* **Gain insights** on the current status of fosterers

Foster Family is **optimised for use** via a Command Line Interface (CLI). This means you interact with it by typing commands in the command box. It also retains the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing you to interact with the application through graphical components. If you can type fast, Foster Family can get things done faster than traditional GUI apps.

This user guide contains **all** the commands available to you, along with **step-by-step explanations** and **examples** to help you master the use of Foster Family. If you are a _new user_, simply head over to [Quick Start](#quick-start) to begin your journey with us. For those who are _already acquainted_, you can refer to the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) below to navigate to your command of interest.

## User Interface (UI)
These are the two different screens you will be interacting with in Foster Family. 

### The Main Window 
![Ui](images/Ui.png)
This is the main view that welcomes you when you start up Foster Family.

### The Profile Page 
![Profile](images/screenshots/ProfilePage.png)
This is the profile view that you can use to add a fosterer or edit the details of an existing fosterer. 

<br>

#### How to open the profile page
There are two ways you can use to navigate to the profile page. 
1. Enter <code>add</code> to view an _empty_ profile page to [add](#adding-a-fosterer-through-the-profile-page-add) a fosterer.
2. Enter either <code>edit INDEX</code> or <code>view INDEX</code> to [edit](#editing-a-fosterers-detail-through-the-profile-page-edit) or [view](#viewing-a-fosterers-detail-view) the fosterer at index <code>INDEX</code> in Foster Family.

Let's say you want to open the profile page of a fosterer name Benson Meie who is currently at index 1. 
![Benson](images/screenshots/BensonMeieView.png)
<br>

To do so, enter <code>view 1</code> as shown in the image above, which opens the profile page of the fosterer at index 1, Benson Meie. 

![Example profile](images/screenshots/EditExample.png)

<br>

#### Navigating through the fields
Typing in the name of the field you want to edit, or substrings of the field, directs your cursor to the textbox, allowing you to make changes.

![Before typing name](images/screenshots/BeforeEnteringName.png)

In the example above, entering <code>name</code>, or a substring of name like <code>nam</code> brings the focus to the name field.

![Profile navigate field](images/screenshots/NavigatingFields.png)

After you are done editing, pressing the Enter key on your keyboard brings your cursor back to the command box with your new changes intact. <br>
If you wish to revert back to the original value of the field while editing in the textbox, press the Esc key to undo the changes and direct your cursor back to the command box. 

![Cursor back to commandbox](images/screenshots/CursorBackToCommandbox.png)
In the example above, after changing name from 'Meie' to 'Mei' the Enter key was pressed. 

The same process can be applied to other fields.

<br>

#### Saving changes
Entering <code>save</code> saves the changes you made into the storage.

Let's say after changing the name, you want to save your changes.
![Cursor back to commandbox](images/screenshots/SaveCommandBefore.png)
<br/>
Key in <code>save</code> and press Enter to save the changes. 
<br/>
![Save command after](images/screenshots/SaveCommandAfter.png)
<br/>
This saves the changes you have made and updates the details of a fosterer, or adds a new fosterer with the details inputted (depending on the command used to open the profile page). 

<br>

#### Exiting the profile page
Entering <code>exit</code> closes the profile page and leads you back to the main window.
Attempting to exit without saving your changes will give you a warning message, prompting you to save your changes. 

**1. Changes are saved** <br/>
Let's say you have already saved your changes.
![Exit command saved before](images/screenshots/ExitCommandSavedBefore.png)

<br>

Key in <code>exit</code> and press Enter to close the profile page.
![Exit command saved after](images/screenshots/ExitCommandSavedAfter.png)

<br>

**2. Changes are not saved** <br/>
Let's say you did not save your changes and entered <code>exit</code>. 

![Exit command not saved warning](images/screenshots/ExitCommandNotSavedWarning.png)

<br>

If you press Enter again, your changes are discarded and you are redirected back to the main window.
If you press the Esc key, the exit is cancelled and you can continue working on your changes in the profile page.

![Exit command not saved cancel](images/screenshots/ExitCommandNotSavedCancel.png)
<br>
The image above is the result of pressing the Esc key after you are warned.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are  parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/urgent` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, _**including zero times**_.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. zero times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `reset`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines, as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

  ![Add](images/screenshots/AddErrorMessage.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

**:exclamation: Important:**<br>

You cannot add duplicate fosterers. This is detected using the fosterer's name.<br>
e.g. <code>"Anne Tay"</code> is the same person as <code>"anne tay"</code> and <code>"anne  (multiple spaces)  tay"</code>.

</div> 


Examples:
* `add n/Jerry Tan p/98765412 e/jerry123@example.com a/Baker street, block 5, #27-01 housing/HDB availability/NotAvailable animal/Dexter animalType/current.Cat t/Urgent`
  * adds a fosterer named Jerry Tan with the following details:
    ![Add](images/screenshots/AddJerry.png)
* `add n/Pete Tay p/98765411 e/pete@example.com a/Happy street, block 5, #27-01 housing/Condo availability/Available animal/nil animalType/able.Cat`
  * adds a fosterer named Pete Tay with the following details:
    ![Add](images/screenshots/AddPete.png)

In the case where duplicates field descriptions are given, the last one will be chosen:
* `add n/Jerry Tan p/98765412 e/jerry123@example.com a/Baker street, block 5, #27-01 housing/HDB housing/Condo availability/Available availability/NotAvailable animal/Dexter animal/Happy animalType/able.Dog animalType/current.Cat t/Urgent`
  * adds a fosterer named Jerry Tan, who lives in a Condo and is fostering a cat named Happy.
    ![Add](images/screenshots/AddDuplicate.png)

### Adding a fosterer through the profile page: `add`

Redirects you to an empty profile page with all the fields set to `nil`. In the profile page, you can key in the fosterer's details and save the 
information, which then adds the fosterer to your address book.

Format: `add`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command:**<br>

*  The restrictions imposed on what makes a valid fosterer, as explained in the section [Adding a fosterer through the main window: add](#adding-a-fosterer-through-the-main-window-add), still applies in this alternative way of adding a fosterer.

</div>

![Profile](images/screenshots/ProfilePage.png)

To learn more about the profile page, please refer to the section [User Interface: The Profile Page](#the-profile-page).  

### Listing fosterers: `list` (Alias: `find`)

Lists fosterers in your address book that match a particular description or search, or all fosterers if the search is blank.

Format: `list *KEYWORDS`

Alias: `find`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command:**<br>

* The keywords are case-insensitive.

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.

* All fields are searched (including tags).

* Keywords can match as parts of words. e.g. `john` will match `Johnny`.
* Keywords can overlap. e.g. `samm my` will match `Sammy`.

* Fosterers must match all keywords (i.e. `AND` search).<br>
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hansbo Grahm`, but not `Hans Duo`.

* Use double quotes `"` for exact, case-sensitive, word-level match.<br>
  e.g. `"Tom"` matches "Tom", but not "Tommy".

* Symbols between keywords or sections will combine them according to the function of the symbol.<br>

| Symbol / Operator | Description              | Precedence |
|-------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| `&`               | Logical AND              | lowest     |
| `/`               | Logical OR               | low        |
| `' '` (space)     | Logical AND              | high       |
| `(` and `)`       | Parentheses for grouping | highest    |

e.g. `a & b / c d` is the same as `a & (b / (c & d))`.

</div>

Examples:
* `list`
    * lists all fosterers in the address book.
* `list john doe`
    * lists entries which match "John Doe", "Doe John", "Johnny Doe", and "Mary" who lives on "John Doe Street".
* `find john john doe`
    * is redundant and gives the same result as `find john doe`.
* `list "John" / zam & doe`
    * lists entries which match "John Doe" and "Doe Shazam", but not "John Grahm".

### Viewing a fosterer's detail: `view`

Redirects you to the profile page of the index-th fosterer in the list currently displayed in your address book.

Format: `view INDEX`

Parameters:

| Parameter | About                                                                                                                                                                | Example |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `INDEX`     | - Index of a fosterer displayed in the list obtained from a `list`/`find` command <br/> - Index must be a positive integer | `1`, `2`, `3` |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Tip:**<br>

* The index of the fosterer has to be provided, however the number of parameters to be edited can vary from zero to all fields.
* `NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, and `ADDRESS` are compulsory.<br/>
  Empty compulsory values disable the save command that saves the edited fosterer data.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

**:exclamation: Important:**<br>

* If the parameters are not provided, <b><code>edit INDEX</code> operates the same way as <code>view INDEX</code></b>, leading you to the profile page of the person at index <code>INDEX</code> in the addressbook. 
* If you ran the same `edit` command multiple times consecutively (resulting in no visible change after the first run), the `undo` command would not be able to revert the data back to the original state 
since it can only undo the last _valid_ command ran.

</div>

Examples:
*  `find` or `list` followed by `edit 3 n/John` 
   * edits the name of the 3rd fosterer in the address book to John.
*  `find` or `list` followed by `edit 1 p/12345678 animal/Bob` 
  * edits the phone number and the pet name of the 1st fosterer in the address book to 12345678 and Bob respectively.
*  `find` or `list` followed by `edit 2` 
  * changes the view to the profile page of the 2nd fosterer in the address book since parameters are not provided.

**:bulb: Tip:**<br>

You can delete multiple fosterers at once.<br> 

* Each index needs to be separated by a white space.<br>
* Any duplicates and extra white spaces will be ignored.

</div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` 
  * deletes the 2nd fosterer in your address book.
* `find Jerry` or `list Jerry`, followed by `delete 1`
  * deletes the 1st fosterer in the result list of your `find` / `list` query
* `list` followed by `delete 1 3 7` 
  * deletes the 1st, 3rd and 7th fosterers in your address book.
    ![Delete](images/screenshots/Delete.png)
In this example, Alex, Bernice and Charlotte are the fosterers deleted. <br>
  

* `list` followed by `delete 3 3 3 3` 
  * deletes the 3rd fosterer in your address book.

### Sorting fosterers: `sort`

Sorts your list of fosterers alphabetically, by name.

Format: `sort`

![Sort](images/screenshots/Sort.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

**:exclamation: Important:**<br>

If you run the `sort` command multiple times consecutively (resulting in no visible change after the first run), the `undo` command would not be able to revert the data back to the original state
since it can only undo the last _valid_ command ran.

</div> 

### Viewing Statistics of Available Fosterers : `stats avail`

Helps you calculate statistics about fosterers who are available to foster, and the animals they can foster. Percentages are calculated to 2 decimal places.

Format: `stats avail`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command:**<br>

All statistic commands are calculated based on the list currently displayed in your address book.<br>
In the example below, `find available` was first entered, resulting in a list of 2 available fosterers. <br>
`stats avail` was then entered, and we see the resulting statistic reporting all listed fosterers as available. <br>

![Stats](images/screenshots/StatsAllAvail.png)<br>

Therefore, please ensure that the current list is the list you want your statistics to be calculated from.<br>

</div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `stats avail` 
  * calculates statistics of available fosterers, based on all fosterers in your address book.<br>
  Here, your have 6 fosterers in your address book, and 3 of them are available to foster.

    ![Stats](images/screenshots/StatsAvail.png)<br>


* `find cat` followed by `stats avail` 
  * calculates statistics of available fosterers, based on fosterers who are either currently fostering a cat or are able to foster a cat.


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:warning: Caution:**<br>

For all stat commands, percentages may not add up to 100.00%.<br>
Suppose you have 3 available fosterers: 1 can foster a dog, 1 can foster a cat and 1 unknown.<br>
* The calculated percentages will add up to 99.99%, instead of 100.00%.<br> 
* Hence, it can be assumed that each group takes up 1/3 of 100.00%.

![Stats](images/screenshots/StatsTotalPercent.png)

</div>

### Viewing Statistics of Current Fosterers : `stats current`
Helps you calculate statistics about fosterers who are currently fostering, and the type of animals they are fostering. Percentages are calculated to 2 decimal places.

Format: `stats current`

Examples:
* `list` followed by `stats current` 
  * calculates statistics of current fosterers, based on all fosterers in your address book. <br>
  Here, you have 6 fosterers in your address book, and 2 of them are currently fostering.
  ![Stats](images/screenshots/StatsCurrent.png)<br>


* `find dog` followed by `stats current`
  * calculates statistics of current fosterers, based on fosterers who are either currently fostering a dog,  or are able to foster a dog.

### Viewing Housing Statistics : `stats housing`
Helps you calculate statistics about the various housing types of fosterers. Percentages are calculated to 2 decimal places.

Format: `stats housing`

Examples:
* `list` followed by `stats housing`
  * calculates housing statistics based on all fosterers in your address book.<br>
  Here, out of the 6 fosterers in your address book, 3 live in HDBs, 1 live in a Condo, and 2 live in Landed properties.
    ![Stats](images/screenshots/StatsHousing.png)<br>
  

* `find available` followed by `stats housing` 
  * calculates housing statistics based on fosterers who are available.

### Undoing the previous command : `undo`

Undoes your previous command, given that the previous command successfully executed is either `add`, `delete`, `edit`, or `sort`.

Format: `undo`

![Undo](images/screenshots/Undo.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command:**<br>

*  The `undo` command can only be executed **once** at a time, and it will undo your last successful command. When the `undo` command is executed consecutively more than once, an error message will be shown:
![Undo](images/screenshots/UndoError.png)

</div>

### Clearing all entries : `reset` and `reset confirm`

Clears all your entries from the address book.

Format: `reset`, followed by `reset confirm`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command:**<br>

*  Upon entering `reset`, a confirmation message will be shown for the user to verify if he/she really wants to clear all the data entries.
![Reset](images/screenshots/Reset.png)

   * User is prompted to enter `reset confirm` to confirm and execute the deletion of all data entries.
![Reset](images/screenshots/ResetConfirm.png)
   * In the case where the user wishes to cancel the reset, he/she just has to proceed and type any other command in the command box.

</div>

### Exiting Foster Family : `exit`

Exits the app.

Format: `exit`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command:**<br>

* On the profile page, entering <code>exit</code> leads you out of the page back to the main window. 
* On the profile page, attempting to <code>exit</code> without saving changes with <code>save</code> prompts a warning message (refer to [User Interface: The Profile Page: Exiting the profile page](#exiting-the-profile-page)). 

</div>


### Saving data

In the main window, your Foster Family data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data, so no manual saving is needed. However, edits made in the profile page have to be saved via the `save` command. Else, changes will be discarded once you exit out of that fosterer's profile page.

### Editing data file

Your Foster Family data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. We strongly
advise you to update the data file directly only if you are an advanced user. Otherwise, we highly recommend you to perform 
edits using our user-friendly interface instead.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:warning: Caution:**<br>

* If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Foster Family will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to make a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
* If your changes create an [invalid fosterer](#adding-a-fosterer-through-the-main-window--add), the app will not start. You will have to rectify the error in order to restart the app.

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer, and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Foster Family home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The solution is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
